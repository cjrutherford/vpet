# vpet Application

A TypeScript application built with NestJS.

## Description

vpet is a [placeholder description of the application's purpose here].  It's designed to [briefly state the application's core functionality].

## Prerequisites

Before running vpet, you'll need the following:

*   **Node.js:** Version 16 or higher is recommended.
*   **npm or yarn:**  For managing dependencies.
*   **PostgreSQL:**  The application requires a PostgreSQL database.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL - replace with the actual URL]
    cd vpet
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install  # or yarn install
    ```

## Configuration

1.  **Database Configuration:**

    Create a PostgreSQL database named `vpet_db`.  Update the following environment variables with your database credentials:

    ```
    DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/vpet_db"
    ```

    *   `user`: Your PostgreSQL username.
    *   `password`: Your PostgreSQL password.
    *   `localhost`:  The address of your PostgreSQL server.
    *   `5432`: The default PostgreSQL port.

    Alternatively, you can set these environment variables directly in your shell or through a `.env` file (recommended for production).

2.  **Other Environment Variables:** (These are examples, adjust as needed)

    ```
    PORT=3000
    # Add any other environment variables here, such as API keys, etc.
    ```

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run start:dev
    ```

    This will start the NestJS development server, typically on port 3000.

## Testing

1.  **Unit Tests:**
    ```bash
    npm run test
    ```

2.  **Integration Tests:**
    ```bash
    npm run test:e2e
    ```
